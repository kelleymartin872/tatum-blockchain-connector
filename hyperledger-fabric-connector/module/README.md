# Quorum Connector

Quorum is an open-source, private-permissioned blockchain compatible with Ethereum. It provides enhanced enterprise functionality with multiple pluggable consensus mechanisms, enterprise-grade permissions management, and transaction privacy features. Developed by J.P. Morgan, and later acquired by ConsenSys, the blockchain is used to run the Interbank Information Network, a payments network that involves more than 300 banks. 

The Quorum network is not run by Tatum, developers should connect to their own private instance.
